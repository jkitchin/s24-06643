In Windows it might be called the DOS prompt, or Powershell, or if you have the Linux Subsystem installed, it is just a terminal. On a Mac/Linux system it is also often called a terminal. Terminals usually do not have a lot of functionality compared to a \"Window/GUI\" system. In fact, you can run a terminal in systems where there is in GUI present.\n",
