    "Introduction to GitHUB\n",
    "=======================\n",
    "\n",
    "So far we have only used git locally, i.e. in the JupyterHUB. git was designed to be distributed, which means used on many machines, and collaborative, i.e. many people can make contributions. A common model for doing this is there is a central location where a repository is saved. Anyone can make a copy of that repository (called a clone) on their local machine. Then they can make modifications to their copy, and optionally push the changes back to the central location.\n",
    "\n",
    "[GitHUB](https://github.com/) is one such solution. To use GitHUB you need to make an account with them. You can see my account at [](https://github.com/jkitchin). There you can find all the public repositories I have worked on, and you can look at the source code and version history of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "GitHUB provides many features beyond just git. There is a feature called GitHUB actions that can automate different activities like running tests. There is also GitHUB Codespaces where you can develop software directly in your browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are other sites similar to GitHUB: GitLab and Bitbucket are two common ones. All of them have a free tier, and a paid tier with more features.\n",
